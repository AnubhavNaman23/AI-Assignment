# LQT AI Assignment - Project Description

The LQT AI Assignment is a comprehensive full-stack web application that demonstrates advanced AI/ML capabilities through a professional AI Developer Portfolio. Built with Python Flask backend and vanilla JavaScript frontend, this interactive web application features a sophisticated dashboard for real-time machine learning operations. The project showcases multiple ML algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine, with comprehensive performance comparison and dynamic visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn. The responsive web interface, powered by Bootstrap 5, provides users with real-time data generation capabilities, automated model training processes, and an interactive prediction system. The application features a complete REST API architecture supporting data operations, model training endpoints, and prediction services, all integrated with AJAX-powered frontend components for seamless user experience. Users can generate synthetic datasets, train multiple ML models simultaneously, visualize data relationships through correlation matrices and distribution plots, analyze model performance metrics, and make real-time predictions through an intuitive dashboard interface. This project perfectly demonstrates modern full-stack AI development practices, combining machine learning expertise with professional web application architecture, making it an ideal showcase of contemporary AI development capabilities and web engineering skills.
